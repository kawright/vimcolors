# vimcolors

`vimcolors` is a set of small shell scripts for changing the environment
variables used in my personal .vimrc file used for color themes.

## Installation

Copy the files `vimlight` and `vimdark` into `/usr/local/bin` folder:

`$ sudo cp vimlight /usr/local/bin/vimlight && cp vimdark /usr/local/bin/vimdark`

## Usage

Run `source vimlight` to change the VIM theme to dark-on-light. Run 
`source vimdark` to change the VIM theme to light-on-dark.
